In this project, I delve into the analysis of COVID-19 vaccination data, focusing on extracting insights regarding vaccination efficacy through the number of tests and doses administered to individuals.

## Introduction
This project is my journey into analyzing COVID-19 vaccination data to contribute to the global understanding of vaccination campaign effectiveness using MySQL.

## Core Functionalities and Queries
I've employed various MySQL features to conduct this analysis:

**Concatenation**: For displaying individuals' full names.
Average and Percentage Calculations: To determine the vaccination campaign's efficiency.
**Data Deletion**: To clean the data for analysis.
**Table Creation**: For segmenting the analysis.
**Conditional Filtering**: For analyzing data according to specific criteria.
**Join Operations**: To enrich the analysis with additional data.
**Duplicate Management**: To ensure analysis accuracy.
